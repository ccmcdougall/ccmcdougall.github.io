### Welcome!
Welcome to my research website! I am a multidisciplinary imaging scientist currently working as a postdoctoral associate in the [Stroke & Cognition Research Group](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/cerebral-circulation-cognition/stroke-cognition) led by [Dr. Philip Barber](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/departments/dcns/about/faculty/barber). This site is maintained as a directory for access to my work across multiple websites and paltforms, as well as a programming blog which provides helpful tutorials & walkthroughs of practical problems to help with building python-based analysis pipelines (coming soon).
